first you should know what are directives and contexts???

>>>>nginx config consists of key value pairs are called directives. It decides which confuguration to apply . They can be organized and grouped into blocks called contexts 
>>>contexts looks like tree like structures that can be nested within one another and directives can only be used within contexts

directive looks like

user nginx;
worker_proecesses 5;

conetxt looks like

#main context 

.....
....

#http context
http{
 directive
 directive
}
